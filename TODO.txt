***TAG issues***

1) <placeName><placeName>Roma</placeName>nos</placeName>

> demonym contains toponym
correct is

Romanos
(no tag)

2) <placeName><placeName>Roma</placeName>e</placeName>

> nominative contains inflected form
correct is 

<placeName>Romae</placeName>


3) <placeName><placeName>Italia</placeName>que</placeName>

> enclitic is present

<placeName><placeName>Italia</placeName>que</placeName>
this tagging is correct!!!


4) <placeName><placeName>Italia</placeName>eque</placeName>

> case 2) and 3) combined!

correct is 
<placeName><placeName>Italiae</placeName>que</placeName>



Possible(partial) solution:

enclitics =  a list of enclitics, that have to be separated (-que, -ne, -ue, -ce, -met, -dum, -cum) 
demonym_inflection = a list of derivational morphemes indicative of demonyms (n,c)
examples
Italiaque
Romanus
Syriaca

general rule: when projecting the annotations to the TEI, always include characters that are attached.
Add each consecutive character until
- next is non character (punctuation, whitespace, number …)
- what is left until the first non character is an enclitic
- next character is “n”
 


***TRAIN improvements******

- add the possibility of passing a folder to the training, containing more than one TEI, to be combined in one training set - DONE
